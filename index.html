Medical fibers are the monomers of biotextiles that could be either natural polymers or synthetic (manmade ones). The difference between synthetic and natural polymers is that synthetic ones can be synthesized and modified in a controlled manner to achieve a specific properties for a given application. Both have shown to be effective as suitable suture materials especially natural polymers such as silk and linen fibers which have been used for over 500 years and non-absorbable polymers such as nylon, polypropylene  and other monofilament sutures with absorbable properties. Playing an integral role in medicine today they are manufactured using various methods such as melt extrusion, wet/gel spinning, electrospinning, centrifugal spinning and hydrogen fiber spinning all of which are going to be discussed more thoroughly in this article.

        “Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller, 2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”
